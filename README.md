# Share-Button
 We learn how to create a Share Button. We use HTML and CSS  for this Share Button.
Creating a Share Button using HTML and CSS involves creating an HTML button element and styling it with CSS to make it visually appealing. The button can be linked to a JavaScript function that will execute when the user clicks on it.

To implement the share functionality, the JavaScript function can use the built-in browser APIs such as the "navigator.share()" method to open a native sharing dialogue box. This box allows the user to share the current page or a specific URL to different social media platforms or messaging apps.

The CSS styling can be used to customize the button's appearance, such as setting the font, background color, and adding hover effects. The styling can help make the button more prominent and draw the user's attention to it.

Overall, creating a Share Button using HTML and CSS is a simple and effective way to add social sharing functionality to a website or web application.
